# Home: Where the heart is

It's my dot files! These are currently managed by [dotter], see `.dotter/global.toml` for how/where these files are
deployed.

## Features
 - [Albert] plugins for seeing currently playing audio (via MPRIS) and copying emoji from their codes (e.g. `:+1:`
   becomes :+1:).
 - Far too many emacs and tmux tweaks.
 - Fish shell with current [opam] switch in the prompt.
